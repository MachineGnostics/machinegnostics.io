# train_test_split: Random Train/Test Data Splitter

The `train_test_split` function provides a simple and flexible way to split your dataset into random training and testing subsets. It is compatible with numpy arrays and can also handle lists or tuples as input. This function is essential for evaluating machine learning models on unseen data and is a core utility in most ML workflows.

---

## Overview

Splitting your data into training and testing sets is a fundamental step in machine learning. The `train_test_split` function allows you to:

- Randomly partition your data into train and test sets.
- Specify the proportion or absolute number of test samples.
- Shuffle your data for unbiased splitting.
- Use a random seed for reproducibility.
- Split both features (`X`) and targets (`y`) in a consistent manner.

## Parameters

| Parameter     | Type                | Default | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|---------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `X`           | array-like          | â€”       | Feature data to be split. Must be indexable and of consistent length.       |
| `y`           | array-like or None  | None    | Target data to be split alongside X. Must be same length as X.              |
| `test_size`   | float or int        | 0.25    | If float, fraction of data for test set (0.0 < test_size < 1.0). If int, absolute number of test samples. |
| `shuffle`     | bool                | True    | Whether to shuffle the data before splitting.                               |
| `random_seed` | int or None         | None    | Controls the shuffling for reproducibility.                                 |

## Returns

- **X_train, X_test**: `np.ndarray`  
  Train-test split of X.

- **y_train, y_test**: `np.ndarray` or `None`  
  Train-test split of y. If y is None, these will also be None.

---

## Raises

- **ValueError**  
  If inputs are invalid or `test_size` is not appropriate.

- **TypeError**  
  If `test_size` is not a float or int.

## Example Usage

```python
import numpy as np
from machinegnostics.models import train_test_split

# Create sample data
X = np.arange(20).reshape(10, 2)
y = np.arange(10)

# Split into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.3, shuffle=True, random_seed=42
)

print("X_train:", X_train)
print("X_test:", X_test)
print("y_train:", y_train)
print("y_test:", y_test)
```

---

## Notes

- If `y` is not provided, only `X` will be split and `y_train`, `y_test` will be `None`.
- If `test_size` is a float, it must be between 0.0 and 1.0 (exclusive).
- If `test_size` is an int, it must be between 1 and `len(X) - 1`.
- Setting `shuffle=False` will split the data in order, without randomization.
- Use `random_seed` for reproducible splits.
