# Welcome to the Machine Gnostics Tutorials

These tutorials are designed to help you master the Machine Gnostics framework for robust, interpretable, and assumption-free data analysis and machine learning. Whether you are a beginner or an advanced user, you will find step-by-step guides, practical code examples, and conceptual explanations to accelerate your learning.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, please ensure that Machine Gnostics is installed correctly in your environment.

- See the [Installation Guide](../installation.md) for setup instructions.

!!! note
    Machine Gnostics is based on Mathematical Gnostics theorems. The procedures and inference of results may differ from standard statistical methods, offering new perspectives and robust diagnostics.
