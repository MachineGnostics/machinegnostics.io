# Magnet: Machine Gnostic Neural Network

**Magnet** is a next-generation neural network architecture inspired by Mathematical Gnostics (MG). Unlike traditional neural networks that rely on probabilistic backpropagation, Magnet is built on a deterministic, finite, and algebraic foundation—offering new possibilities for robust, interpretable learning.

## What Makes Magnet Unique?

- **Deterministic Learning:** All computations are finite, reproducible, and free from randomness.
- **Event-Level Modeling:** Uncertainty and error are handled at the level of individual data events, not just populations.
- **Algebraic Inference:** Magnet leverages gnostic algebra and error geometry for transparent, explainable results.
- **Resilient Architecture:** Designed to withstand outliers, corrupted data, and distributional shifts.

## Roadmap & Collaboration

Magnet is currently under active development.  
**Coming soon:**  
- Detailed documentation and architecture diagrams  
- Implementation guides and code examples  
- Benchmarks and comparison studies

!!! tip "NOTE"
    **We welcome collaboration and new ideas!**  
    If you’re interested in contributing, sharing feedback, or exploring partnerships, please reach out—your insights can help shape the future of Machine Gnostic neural networks.

**Suggestions for future additions:**

- Add a high-level diagram or conceptual illustration of Magnet’s architecture.
- Include a “Vision” or “Goals” section describing what Magnet aims to solve compared to existing neural networks.
- Provide a link or contact for collaboration (email, GitHub, etc.).
- List planned features or modules (e.g., layers, activation functions, training methods).
- Share any preliminary results or benchmarks if available.
