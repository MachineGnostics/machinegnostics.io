# Models - Data Analysis (Machine Gnostics)

## Welcome to Machine Gnostics Data Analysis Models

Machine Gnostics provides a unified framework for robust, assumption-free data analysis using advanced statistical and gnostic theory principles. The "Models" section is your entry point to understanding the core analytical tools available in this library.

## What Are Machine Gnostics Models?

Machine Gnostics models are specialized classes and algorithms designed to analyze, interpret, and diagnose data distributions. They go beyond traditional statistics by focusing on universal properties, diagnostic features, and gnostic error measures, making them suitable for a wide range of scientific, engineering, and machine learning applications.

## Key Data Analysis Model Categories

### Gnostic Distribution Distributions (GDF)

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **[EGDF](egdf.md)** (Empirical Gnostics Distribution Function)
-   **[ELDF](eldf.md)** (Empirical Likelihood Distribution Function)
-   **[QGDF](qgdf.md)** (Quantile Gnostics Distribution Function)
-   **[QLDF](qldf.md)** (Quantile Likelihood Distribution Function)

</div>

  These models provide flexible, non-parametric representations of data distributions, supporting both empirical and quantile-based analysis.

### Data Analysis

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **[Cluster Analysis](cluster_analysis.md)**
    Tools for identifying natural groupings and structure in data, supporting unsupervised learning.

-   **[Interval Analysis](interval_analysis.md)**
    Methods for estimating confidence intervals, bounds, and diagnostic regions with robust handling of outliers.

-   **[Homogeneity](homogeneity.md)**
    Functions for assessing data uniformity, analyzing distribution consistency and structural regularity.

-   **[Scedasticity](scedasticity.md)**
    Functions for assessing data variance, volatility, and dispersion characteristics across the dataset.

-   **[Membership](membership.md)**
    Algorithms for quantifying membership relevance and diagnostic scores for individual data points.

-   **[Data Cluster](data_cluster.md)**
    Advanced boundary detection for identifying main clusters from probability density functions.

-   **[Data Interval](data_interval.md)**
    Robust interval estimation engine for adaptive scanning and extracting meaningful data ranges.

## Why Use Machine Gnostics Models?

- **Assumption-Free**: No reliance on normality, linearity, or parametric forms.
- **Universal**: Applicable to any data type or domain.
- **Diagnostic**: Built-in error estimation, entropy measures, and robust statistics.
- **Extensible**: Easily integrates with existing Python data science workflows.
