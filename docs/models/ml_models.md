# Models - Machine Learning (Machine Gnostics)

## Welcome to Machine Gnostics Machine Learning Models

Machine Gnostics provides a growing suite of machine learning models for transparent, robust, and diagnostic predictive analytics. This section introduces the core supervised learning tools available today, and highlights our ongoing development of new models across supervised, unsupervised, and advanced categories.

Our goal is to deliver interpretable, assumption-free machine learning solutions that combine classic algorithms with gnostic diagnostics. Whether you are working on classification, regression, clustering, or other tasks, Machine Gnostics models help you understand both predictions and underlying data structure.

!!! tip "NOTE" 
    We are actively developing additional machine learning models in all categories—including supervised, unsupervised, and more. Stay tuned for updates as new tools and documentation become available.

    We are open to collaboration and new ideas. If you’re interested in contributing, sharing feedback, or exploring partnerships, feel free to connect with us—your insights and creativity are always welcome!
