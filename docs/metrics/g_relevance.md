# hc: Gnostic Characteristics (Hc) Metric

The `hc` function computes the Gnostic Characteristics (Hc) metric for a set of true and predicted values. This metric evaluates the relevance or irrelevance of predictions using gnostic theory, providing robust, assumption-free diagnostics for model performance.

---

## Overview

The Hc metric measures the gnostic relevance or irrelevance between true and predicted values:

- **Case `'i'`**: Estimates gnostic relevance. Values close to one indicate less relevance. Range: [0, 1].
- **Case `'j'`**: Estimates gnostic irrelevance. Values close to 1 indicate less irrelevance. Range: [0, âˆž).

Unlike classical metrics, Hc uses gnostic algebra to provide deeper insight into the relationship between predictions and actual outcomes, especially in the presence of outliers or non-normal data.

## Parameters

| Parameter   | Type       | Description                                                         |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `y_true`  | array-like | True values (list, tuple, or numpy array).                          |
| `y_pred`  | array-like | Predicted values (list, tuple, or numpy array).                     |
| `case`    | str        | `'i'` for relevance, `'j'` for irrelevance. Default: `'i'`.   |
| `verbose` | bool       | If True, enables detailed logging for debugging. Default:`False`. |

---

## Returns

- **float**
  The calculated Hc value (normalized sum of squared gnostic characteristics).

---

## Raises

- **TypeError**If `y_true` or `y_pred` are not array-like.
- **ValueError**
  If inputs are empty, contain NaN/Inf, are not 1D, have mismatched shapes, or if `case` is not `'i'` or `'j'`.

---

## Example Usage

```python
from mango.metrics import hc

# Example 1: Using lists
y_true = [1, 2, 3]
y_pred = [1, 2, 3]
hc_value = hc(y_true, y_pred, case='i')
print(hc_value)

# Example 2: Using numpy arrays and irrelevance case
import numpy as np
y_true = np.array([2, 4, 6])
y_pred = np.array([1, 2, 3])
hc_value = hc(y_true, y_pred, case='j', verbose=True)
print(hc_value)
```

---

## Notes

- The function supports input as lists, tuples, or numpy arrays.
- Both `y_true` and `y_pred` must be 1D, have the same shape, and must not be empty or contain NaN/Inf.
- For standard comparison, irrelevances are calculated with S=1.
- The Hc metric is robust to outliers and non-normal data, providing more reliable diagnostics than classical metrics.

## Gnostic vs. Classical Metrics

> **Note:**
> Unlike traditional metrics that use statistical means, the Hc metric is computed using gnostic algebra and characteristics. This approach is assumption-free and designed to reveal the true diagnostic properties of your data and model predictions.
