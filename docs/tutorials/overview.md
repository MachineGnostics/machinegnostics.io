# Welcome to the Machine Gnostics Tutorials

These tutorials are designed to help you master the Machine Gnostics framework for robust, interpretable, and assumption-free data analysis and machine learning. Whether you are a beginner or an advanced user, you will find step-by-step guides, practical code examples, and conceptual explanations to accelerate your learning.

---

## Getting Started

Before you begin, please ensure that Machine Gnostics is installed correctly in your environment.

- See the [Installation Guide](../installation.md) for setup instructions.
- Check out [Tutorials Library](../tutorials/tutorials.md) for step-by-step instructions.

!!! note
    Machine Gnostics is based on Mathematical Gnostics theorems. The procedures and inference of results may differ from standard statistical methods, offering new perspectives and robust diagnostics.
