# Magnet: Machine Gnostic Neural Network

**Magnet** is the Machine Gnostic (Neural) Network, a novel architecture inspired by the principles of Mathematical Gnostics (MG). Unlike traditional neural networks that rely on probabilistic backpropagation and statistical learning, Magnet is built on a deterministic, finite, and algebraic foundation.

## Key Features

- **Deterministic Learning:** No reliance on probability or randomness; all computations are finite and reproducible.
- **Event-Level Modeling:** Handles uncertainty and error at the level of individual data events, not populations.
- **Algebraic Inference:** Utilizes gnostic algebra and error geometry for robust, interpretable learning.
- **Resilient Architecture:** Designed to be robust against outliers, corrupted data, and distributional shifts.

!!! note "Status"
    Magnet is currently under development.  
    **Coming soon:** Detailed documentation, architecture diagrams, and implementation guides.
